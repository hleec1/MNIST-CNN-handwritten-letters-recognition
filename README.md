Convolutional Neural Networks Models
Using 2 different models, 1 with a traditional convolutional neural network architechture and the other with convolutional neural networks infused with residual blocks.
All of the models were trained with 30 epochs and learning rate of 0.001. The loss function used is the negative log likelihood NLLLoss. For the optimizer, I used the Adam optimizer.
Created using google colab environment.
